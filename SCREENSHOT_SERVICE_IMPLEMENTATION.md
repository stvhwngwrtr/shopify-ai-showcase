# 📸 Screenshot Service Implementation

## ✅ Status: **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

The screenshot service has been successfully integrated and tested with your API key `Lypd9cvi4OvuNA`.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Screenshot Service Module** (`screenshot_service.py`)
- Integrates with ScreenshotOne API for professional screenshot capture
- Supports both URL and HTML content screenshots
- Graceful fallback when not configured
- Automatic error handling and retries

### 2. **Instagram Preview Endpoint** (`/api/instagram-preview/<session_id>`)
- Serves standalone, pixel-perfect Instagram post HTML
- Includes proper SVG icons, gradients, and modern UI styling
- Fully responsive and ready for screenshot capture
- Can be used for debugging and preview purposes

### 3. **Updated Recording Flow** (in `app.py`)
The system now follows this intelligent flow:

```
1. User clicks "📤 Upload to Artifact Theater"
   ↓
2. System generates Instagram post HTML with:
   - Product image
   - Caption with emojis
   - Modern Instagram UI (icons, likes, etc.)
   ↓
3. IF screenshot service is configured:
   ✅ Send HTML to ScreenshotOne API
   ✅ Receive high-quality screenshot (JPEG)
   ✅ Perfect SVG icons, gradients, typography
   ELSE:
   ⚠️  Fallback to PIL-based generation (basic quality)
   ↓
4. Upload screenshot to Cloudinary
   ↓
5. Store record in MongoDB with:
   - Product details
   - Mockup image URL
   - Session ID
   - Metadata
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Screenshot service not working
**Solution**: Check `.env` file has:
```bash
USE_SCREENSHOT_SERVICE=true
SCREENSHOT_API_KEY=Lypd9cvi4OvuNA
```

### Issue: Poor quality mockups
**Check**: Is screenshot service enabled?
- If enabled: Should see "📸 Attempting screenshot capture via HTML..." in logs
- If fallback: Will see "🎨 Generating new Instagram mockup (fallback)"

### Issue: Localhost URLs not working
**Reason**: External services can't access `localhost`
**Solution**: We use HTML capture (sends HTML directly) ✅ Already implemented
